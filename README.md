# Coffee_Shop_Sales_Data_Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation by Using PowerBI)
##Project Objective
  The objective of this project is to design an interactive Power BI dashboard for a Coffee Shop that provides business leaders with real-time insights into sales performance. The dashboard tracks key performance      indicators (KPIs) such as Total Sales, Total Orders, and Quantity Sold, while also analyzing:
  Sales trends over time
  Weekend vs Weekday sales performance
  Store-wise and product-wise sales contributions
  Peak sales hours to identify customer buying patterns
  This project demonstrates how raw transactional data can be transformed into actionable insights using Power BI, DAX, and data visualization techniques.
